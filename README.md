# LINKS-Workshop-2023-Intrermediate-SNA
The [LINKS Center for Social Network Analysis](https://links.uky.edu/) at the University of Kentucky offers a series of [workshops](https://www.linksworkshop.org/home) on social network analysis (SNA) every summer, usually in June. 

#### Track 3. Intermediate Social Network Analysis (R) - June 5-9, 2023 (10:00-12:00pm and 12:45-2:45pm, ET)

This course is taught by [Filip Agneessens](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xeT4nakAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Francisco Trincado-Munoz](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5QH5lbBDx60C&hl=en) and runs with twice daily sessions for one week, starting June 5 (Monday) and ending June 9 (Friday). It is a more technical and in-depth workshop than the Introductory workshop, but covers many of the same concepts (see the Schedule below). It focuses on the concepts and methods of SNA, particularly as they apply to specific research objectives. In this course, everything is related back to the research questions –– how the network analysis relates to consequences of interest (see also, Agneessens, 2020).  In addition, the mathematics and algorithms behind the measures and techniques is explained. The textbook used for this course is "Borgatti, Everett, Johnson and Agneessens (2022) [Analyzing Social Networks Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Social-Networks-Using-R-ebook-dp-B09YMFBVX2/dp/B09YMFBVX2/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=). Sage".

Prior familiarity with some basic concepts in social network analysis is assumed. Different social network packages in R will be used. However, no prior knowledge of R is required. Please ensure that you have previously downloaded a recent version of R and RStudio and also ensure that you are able to download R packages such as "igraph". Visit our software page long in advance of the workshop for details.  

Meeting times for the course will be 10:00am-12:15 (ET) and 12:45-3:00pm (ET) on instructional days. At the end of each day, participants will receive homework, which includes running analyses and interpreting results, and which they can perform in small groups of 2-3. These results will then be discussed in the next meeting.
